PEtabSelect.jl is a lightweight Julia wrapper for the Python package [petab-select](https://github.com/PEtab-dev/petab_select); a package for automatic model selection for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) models. This package is not intended for direct use, as it needs a full [PEtab](https://petab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) importer in order to perform model selection.
